Glean offers several impressive features for retrieving insights and data, enhancing the overall search experience within enterprises. Here are some of the standout capabilities:

## Comprehensive Search Across Applications
Glean enables users to search across all company applications, websites, and data sources. This unified enterprise search respects existing permissions, ensuring that users only access information they are authorized to see. The system factors in user roles, projects, and collaboration patterns to deliver highly personalized results, significantly reducing time spent searching for relevant information[1][3].

## Semantic Understanding
Utilizing deep learning-based large language models (LLMs), Glean provides semantic understanding for natural language queries. This capability allows users to input queries in a conversational manner, making it easier to retrieve contextually relevant information[3].

## Personalized Recommendations
Glean incorporates a recommendation engine that surfaces timely and contextually relevant information based on user behavior and interactions. By leveraging vector embeddings trained using AI technologies, Glean can suggest documents and knowledge that are particularly pertinent to individual users or systems[1][3].

## API Integration
The Glean Indexing API allows organizations to index arbitrary content, including internal tools and custom entities. This flexibility means that even data from applications not natively supported by Glean can be made searchable, enhancing the breadth of insights available[2][5].

## Verified Answers and Curated Collections
Glean captures answers to frequently asked questions and verifies their accuracy, ensuring that users receive reliable information. Additionally, teams can organize related documents into curated collections for easier onboarding and knowledge management[3].

## Security and Compliance
Glean is built with enterprise security in mind, enforcing strict permission controls and compliance with regulations like GDPR. This focus on security ensures that sensitive information is adequately protected while still being accessible to authorized users[3][4].

## Seamless Interoperability
With over 100 connectors to popular applications like Google Workspace and Slack, Glean integrates smoothly into existing workflows. This interoperability allows for efficient data utilization across various platforms, making it easier for users to access the insights they need without switching between different tools[4][1].

These features collectively make Glean a powerful tool for enterprises looking to enhance their data retrieval capabilities and streamline knowledge management processes.
